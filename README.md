# TimeTest

This study investigates whether SwiftUI performs layout tasks faster than Flutter on iOS devices by measuring view layout times of equivalent views across eight real-world devices, using two applications - one written in Swift/SwiftUI, and the other in Dart/Flutter.

Full report and all data is included in the [Data](Data) folder.  
Full Code for the SwiftUI application can be found in the [Swift](Swift) folder.  
Full Code for the Flutter application can be found in the [Flutter](Flutter) folder.
